            What if the epicenter of entertainment moved from LA to Silicon
            Valley? How would content creation evolve in a world driven by
            algorithms? Could it lead to failures, and how might audiences adapt
            to this new dynamic? What would resistance against this change look
            like?
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            To explore these questions, Thomas Euyang created four fictional
            organizations: Limbic, Neulu, The American Federation of Audiences,
            and Cine46, each brought to life through unique artifacts. Guiding
            you through this speculative landscape is Lawrence “Larry” Hoo,
            Thomas’ alter ego and a reporter from this imagined world. Hoo’s
            notes provide insights into how AI-driven innovations could reshape
            media, entertainment, and culture at large.

            This website, a collaborative effort hand-coded by Thomas with the
            invaluable assistance of Omar Mohammad, invites you to dive into a
            future where technology and storytelling collide.
